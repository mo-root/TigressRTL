    # langchain_ollama, it dumps the tool call as a raw JSON string in the
    # response's plain text content instead of populating the structured
    # tool_calls field — so response.tool_calls comes back empty/None and
    # nothing actually executes. Declared capability metadata isn't proof
    # of working behavior — verify empirically before trusting it.
    #
    # llama3.2 reliably produces structured tool_calls, but empirically
    # fails in other ways: garbled/truncated multi-line content in
    # tool-call arguments, narrating fake pseudo-tool-calls as plain text
    # instead of invoking them, and confidently hallucinating tool results
    # that contradict what the tool actually returned in the same response.

    # OpenHands scaffold) is the first model tested here with none of those
    # problems in a full end-to-end run: real structured tool_calls with
    # complete, untruncated, valid SystemVerilog content; build succeeded
    # on the first try; and its final answer was a byte-for-byte accurate
    # description of what was actually written to disk. It's ~14GB and
    # noticeably slower per turn on limited-GPU hardware (mostly CPU
